## Project Description
This project explores binary trees, a hierarchical data structure essential in computer science. Through this project, you will learn how to:
- Create and manage binary trees.
- Implement traversal algorithms (pre-order, in-order, post-order).
- Measure properties like depth, height, size, and balance.
- Check for structural completeness, fullness, and perfection.

---

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you should be able to explain and implement:
- What is a binary tree and its types.
- The differences between binary trees and Binary Search Trees (BSTs).
- Depth, height, size, and other structural properties of binary trees.
- Various traversal methods.
- The concepts of complete, full, perfect, and balanced binary trees.

## Requirements
- **Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, gcc (version 9.3.0).
- **Editors**: vi, vim, emacs.
- **Coding Standards**: Use the Betty style for all C files.
- **Compilation Flags**: `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- **File Format**: Each C file must start with function documentation and end with a newline.

## Installation and Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/binary_trees.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd binary_trees
   ```
3. Compile the files using `gcc`:
   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89 <file_name.c> -o <output_name>
   ```
4. Run your compiled program:
   ```bash
   ./<output_name>
   ```

## Fun Fact
- Yo mama so fat, she sat on a binary tree and flanted it into a linked list in 0(1) time.
- Yo mama's so big, the binary tree storing her data became a forest.
